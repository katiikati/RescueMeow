- Rescue Meow is a visual novel-esque game about a rescuing a kitty :3 There are simple mini quests to get the cat clean, fed, and happy <3

- Made with Unity and C# with diologue system using Ink

- I wanted to make a simple and cute game with my friend who does art. We decided to make a cat game since cats are super cute and we found a touching story about a rescue cat online
  
- I struggled with making the game fun since most of the mini quests are pretty easy. However, a few simple adjustments to the UI made the game much more visually pleasing and interesting
